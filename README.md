   Handles the efficient uploading of your React project files for deployment.

2. **Deploy Service**  
   Manages the deployment process, ensuring that your application is hosted and scaled effectively.

3. **Request Handler**  
   Oversees requests between the backend services and the user interface to maintain smooth operation.

4. **Frontend**  
   Provides the user interface for interacting with SkyCode, allowing developers to manage their projects with ease.
